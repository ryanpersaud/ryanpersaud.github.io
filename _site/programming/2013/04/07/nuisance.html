Fittingly for this post, Wordpress is converting it into a space, regardless of how I attempt to escape it.).  Off the top of my I head I could not think of a better workaround than to create a variable with &amp;nbsp; in it, and then use the variable in the comparison: var thisisdumb = &quot;&amp;nb&quot; + &quot;sp;&quot; if (input == thisisdumb) That worked, but it felt distinctly unsatisfying, and kind of dirty.  I told the dev to ask somebody if there was a way to escape &amp;nbsp; so that the framework would ignore it. &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" />
