While all credit card sites require a username and password to login, many require some additional authentication.  For example, Chase requires that you performed MFA at some point in the past on the machine.  It &#39;remembers&#39; that you authenticated by planting a super cookie on your machine if Flash is present, or taking a fingerprint of your browser configuration if Flash is not installed.  One of these must be present when you attempt to login, or you are prompted to perform MFA again.  When I initially logged into the Citi site I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was not a secondary form of authentication (ordinarily, I&#39;m a big fan of MFA and I activate it wherever possible, but it makes scraping a royal pain).  Based on what I was seeing in Firebug, it seemed like writing the Citi scraper would be straightforward.  I quickly hacked up my old Amex scraper to hit the Citi site, but I was not able to login.  I ran out of time, and I moved to Denver, so the scraper got put on the back burner.  After a few weeks in Denver, I realized I had no idea what our spending habits looked like, so I figured it was time to resurrect the scraper. I took another look in Firebug, but I could not see what was preventing my script from logging in.  Eventually, I came across the Tamper Data add-on for Firefox that allows manipulation of a POST request before it is submitted to a remote site.  I removed POST fields one by one until I determine which ones were required for successfully logging in.  Two fields named XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra turned out to be critical.  After some digging, I determined that these two fields were being populated by dynamically generated Javascript when the page loaded.  Apparently, Citi only wants browsers logging into their site, and ensuring that the client can execute Javascript is how they are enforcing this restriction.  At this point, I realized that I was either going to have to try and parse and evaluate Javascript from within Python, or I could shell out to a Javascript runtime and have it execute the Javascript for me.  Neither of these options seemed particularly fun, so I punted for a few more weeks. Eventually, I found myself with a few free hours so I decided to tackle the Javascript issue.  I installed the execjs Python package that allows for Javascript code to be passed to an external Javascript runtime for execution.  I initially tried to use Googe&#39;s V8 for some reason, but it would not build on my Pi, and I&#39;ve done enough debugging of esoteric g++ build errors for a lifetime (Thanks, Shibboleth!).  Then, I remembered that I got node to run on the Pi without too much difficulty a few years earlier.  I reinstalled node and voilà I was able to execute Javascript from my Python scripts.  The hard part was not yet done, as I still needed to figure out which functions in the dynamically generated mess of Javascript to call in order to populate XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra properly. In the blob of Javascript that Citi dynamically generates on the login page, there are four functions called by four jQuery(document).ready() functions (see below).  Each of these appears to manipulate XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra, so it was unclear to me which function was setting the values that I needed to use, or if maybe they all needed to execute in a certain order.  I read a bit about the order of execution of ready() functions and tried to attack the problem from that angle.  Then, I realized that there was some bush-league misdirection going on within 3 of the 4 ready() functions.  Things like input.extrafie1d (note the 1 instead of the l).  So, all I really needed to do was: Scan through the Javascript until I found a ready() function  with the correctly named fields.  Let&#39;s call it legit_ready() Find the function that legit_ready() is calling.  Let&#39;s call it legit_function(). Remove jQuery() usage from legit_function() and add a return statement so that we can retrieve XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra.  Let&#39;s call the result legit_function_mod() Use execjs to execute legit_function_mod().

{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"BlogPosting","dateModified":"2016-10-31T01:50:16+00:00","datePublished":"2016-10-31T01:50:16+00:00","description":"&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt; EDIT: So as Kodiologist notes in the comment section, the same simple Javascript (substring()) is executed every time, so it&#39;s just as easy to evaluate it manually.  However, in early July of 2017, Citi upped their game and there is now obfuscated Javascript code that must be evaluated in order to successfully login.  The code requires DOM to be present, so I had to switch from node.js to phantom.js, but I&#39;ve got something working.  I&#39;ll blog about it in a subsequent post. As I mentioned in a previous blog post, I wrote a budgeting helper program in Python that scrapes purchases from my credit cards&#39; sites and emails me a daily summary of how much I  have spent so far in the current month.  I had scrapers working for my two primary cards for several years and everything was hunky dory until Costco decided to switch from American Express to Citi.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I think the switch was a good move overall, but it forced me to have to write yet another scraper. Perl and Python have made screen scraping an easy, if not enjoyable, task with their HTTP client and regex libraries.  My first real screen scraping endeavor was creating an AIM bot in Perl that could provide fantasy football stats.  This was during the era of pay-for-live-stats, so being able to get free stats was compelling for a skinflint like me.  The script scraped various sports sites to obtain the necessary data.  While I was ultimately able to build the bot, it was of limited utility to anyone but me due to fact that scoring is handled differently from league to league (points per yard, points per reception, etc.).  Also, most fantasy sites soon made live stats free.  Anyway, scraping unprotected sports sites is a straightforward process, but scraping credit card sites is a fair bit more complex.  As you would imagine, most of the difficulty stems from authenticating to the site. While all credit card sites require a username and password to login, many require some additional authentication.  For example, Chase requires that you performed MFA at some point in the past on the machine.  It &#39;remembers&#39; that you authenticated by planting a super cookie on your machine if Flash is present, or taking a fingerprint of your browser configuration if Flash is not installed.  One of these must be present when you attempt to login, or you are prompted to perform MFA again.  When I initially logged into the Citi site I was pleasantly surprised to see that there was not a secondary form of authentication (ordinarily, I&#39;m a big fan of MFA and I activate it wherever possible, but it makes scraping a royal pain).  Based on what I was seeing in Firebug, it seemed like writing the Citi scraper would be straightforward.  I quickly hacked up my old Amex scraper to hit the Citi site, but I was not able to login.  I ran out of time, and I moved to Denver, so the scraper got put on the back burner.  After a few weeks in Denver, I realized I had no idea what our spending habits looked like, so I figured it was time to resurrect the scraper. I took another look in Firebug, but I could not see what was preventing my script from logging in.  Eventually, I came across the Tamper Data add-on for Firefox that allows manipulation of a POST request before it is submitted to a remote site.  I removed POST fields one by one until I determine which ones were required for successfully logging in.  Two fields named XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra turned out to be critical.  After some digging, I determined that these two fields were being populated by dynamically generated Javascript when the page loaded.  Apparently, Citi only wants browsers logging into their site, and ensuring that the client can execute Javascript is how they are enforcing this restriction.  At this point, I realized that I was either going to have to try and parse and evaluate Javascript from within Python, or I could shell out to a Javascript runtime and have it execute the Javascript for me.  Neither of these options seemed particularly fun, so I punted for a few more weeks. Eventually, I found myself with a few free hours so I decided to tackle the Javascript issue.  I installed the execjs Python package that allows for Javascript code to be passed to an external Javascript runtime for execution.  I initially tried to use Googe&#39;s V8 for some reason, but it would not build on my Pi, and I&#39;ve done enough debugging of esoteric g++ build errors for a lifetime (Thanks, Shibboleth!).  Then, I remembered that I got node to run on the Pi without too much difficulty a few years earlier.  I reinstalled node and voilà I was able to execute Javascript from my Python scripts.  The hard part was not yet done, as I still needed to figure out which functions in the dynamically generated mess of Javascript to call in order to populate XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra properly. In the blob of Javascript that Citi dynamically generates on the login page, there are four functions called by four jQuery(document).ready() functions (see below).  Each of these appears to manipulate XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra, so it was unclear to me which function was setting the values that I needed to use, or if maybe they all needed to execute in a certain order.  I read a bit about the order of execution of ready() functions and tried to attack the problem from that angle.  Then, I realized that there was some bush-league misdirection going on within 3 of the 4 ready() functions.  Things like input.extrafie1d (note the 1 instead of the l).  So, all I really needed to do was: Scan through the Javascript until I found a ready() function  with the correctly named fields.  Let&#39;s call it legit_ready() Find the function that legit_ready() is calling.  Let&#39;s call it legit_function(). Remove jQuery() usage from legit_function() and add a return statement so that we can retrieve XXX_Extra and XYZ_Extra.  Let&#39;s call the result legit_function_mod() Use execjs to execute legit_function_mod(). In the example below, tnmECSrrTlV2oA() is the legitimate function. function tnmECSrrTlV2oA() { var bcPY4RwbaIed1kgFGmN; var Cl9dJfqNEg5iVl44 = 1; var fXMHPy14iEBhe3ltWRyo = &#39;vYZc0Afe3ZgbkmE&#39;;
