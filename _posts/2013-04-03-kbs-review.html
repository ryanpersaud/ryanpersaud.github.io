<p>Just shared a KBS with Urn. As you'd imagine, Bourbon was the most noticeable aroma immediately after opening. It was milder than BCBS or Parabola, however. We let it warm up for about 10 minutes and then took a few sips. I was surprised how muted the Bourbon flavor was compared to the other barrel-aged stouts that we had recently tried. Unsurprisingly, it reminded me of FBS with the hints of coffee and chocolate. It's like Founders took Breakfast Stout, tweaked it slightly and then added Bourbon undertones throughout. It's definitely smooth and balanced, and I don't think it would benefit much from cellaring. After a year or two, the Bourbon flavor might disappear entirely. I have the 2012 vintage that Urn got me for my birthday last year, and I'll probably drink it sooner than later. My current ratings are KBS &gt; Parabola &gt; BCBS &gt; Dark Hollow. That said, Parabola and BCBS aged for a year or two might trump KBS.</p>
