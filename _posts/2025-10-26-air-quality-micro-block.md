A few week's ago, I accompanied Erin to her 25th reunion at Colorado Collegein Colorado Springs.  They are one of a few schools that have the block plan where instead of taking multiple classes throughout a semester, students take one class at a time for three and a half weeks.  This means that students have concentrated deep-dives into subjects - it definitely seems to resonate with some students more than others.  I'm still not sure if it would suit my learning style.  I like to deep dive on various topics, but I also recognize that sometimes I need time to internalize material.  During the reunion weekend, Micro Blocks were offered where attendees could get quick exposure to a subject.  I decided to take a Micro Block on Air Quality, and it ended up being quite interesting.

The Micro Block was led by a X, a professor in the Y and Z department.  Like many folks, she got interested in Air Quality during the pandemic.  Rather than trying to regurgitate the content verbatim, I am going to focus on the areas that I found notable.

First, it's helpful to review what PM2.5 (particulate matter 2.5) means (I often forget the precise definition).  It's a measurement of the particles that are 2.5 micrometers or smaller in the air.  The first thing that I typically forget is that it's not just particles that are 2.5 um in diameter, it's <= 2.5um.  It's also important to note that rather than a count, PM2.5 is a measurement of the mass of such particles in a given volume, specifically (ug/m3).  One impact of this definition is that two substances with different masses might have different PM2.5 readings even though the same number of particles are present in air.
