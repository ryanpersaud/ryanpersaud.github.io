<p id="internal-source-marker_0.4753409114356536" dir="ltr">I was looking into screen scraping the sites of some of the financial companies that I use, and the process was pretty similar to what I had done for other projects in the past (fantasy football stat tracker, WMATA train tracker, etc.).  One aspect that differed was the need to authenticate to the site before being able to scrape data.  For most of the sites, it was just a matter of POSTing my credentials to a particular URL.   However, one site presented difficulties because it would only allow logins from ‘authorized’ computers.  Though I did not break any laws in my examination of the site, I am not mentioning the company that owns the site because I don’t want to deal with overzealous lawyers.  For the remainder of this post, I will refer to the company as Vandelay Industries (VI).  The authorization process involved:</p>
<p dir="ltr">a) Attempting to login.</p>
<p dir="ltr">b) Getting a message that the current machine has not been authorized along with a link to send an authorization code to the phone number registered to the account.</p>
<p dir="ltr">c) Keying in the authorization code.</p>
<p dir="ltr">After completing those steps, the computer was now authorized and a user could login as normal.   Armed with a host of Firefox extensions (Firebug, Cookies Manager+ and Better Privacy), I was able to determine that once step c is completed, a Flash Cookie is stored on the computer to record that it has been authorized.  On subsequent visits to the site, the Flash Cookie will be provided to the site, and the user will be able to login.  I verified this by transplanting the flash cookie to a computer that I had not previously authorized and successfully logging in to the site.  This is all well and good, but I had no idea how to integrate a Flash Cookie into a screen scraping script.  After some pondering, I realized that the site could not rely on all machines having Flash, so I fired up a browser that did not have the Flash plugin installed and observed what happened during the authorization process.  My assumption was that ‘normal’ browser cookies would be used, and if the user happened to clear their cookies, then tough luck, they would have to reauthorize their browser.  However, I cleared all of the cookies for the site, and I was still able to login, so clearly cookies were not being used.  After some Googling and poking around, I realized that the site was using browser fingerprinting to authorize a machine (at least the browser).</p>
<p>The basic idea of browser fingerprinting is that a site can collect freely available information about a user’s browser to create a unique profile of that browser.  My initial thought was that there would be a lot of browsers with identical fingerprints, but as you can see from this <a href="https://panopticlick.eff.org/">site </a>that the EFF put together, it is possible to gather a set of information that uniquely identifies browsers, even with a decent sample size (nearly 3 million).  It appears that plug-ins are the most useful at providing unique information.  VI is also banking on the fact that even if multiple browsers have the same fingerprint, the chances that an attacker would have the same fingerprint as an victim are low. That said, fingerprinting has a clear disadvantage when compared to the Flash Cookie approach.  Any site that a user visits can obtain the browser fingerprint, while Flash Cookies ‘should’ only be provided to the site that created the cookie.  An attacker who manages to obtain a victim’s credentials through phishing would have no trouble obtaining a browser fingerprint as well.</body></html></p>
