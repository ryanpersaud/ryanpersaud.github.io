<p>A common problem with old Lexus RX300s is that the key blades begin to separate from the rest of the transmitter. This issue typically first manifests itself as a seemingly ‘loose’ key. Attempts to tighten the screw on the back of the transmitter to firm up the key yield poor results, and may even hasten the full separation of the blade from the rest of the key package. This separation is more than just a nuisance as the electronics in the key need to be in close proximity to the blade/steering column when the key is turned in order for the vehicle to start. I’ve seen varying prices on the Internet for the cost of having the dealer replace these keys, but they’ve all been at least $100. A solution that I’ve used twice now (once for each key) is to buy a blank online and then have a local locksmith dupe my key. Then, I just transplant the innards to the new key which is quite easy because they are in a convenient little bundle. I used <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Uncut-buttons-Blade-RX400H-Inside/dp/B0089A8MAI/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365365481&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=rx+300+key">this</a> blank and I used<a href="http://www.baldinos.com/locations/location.aspx?locId=10"> Baldinos in McLean</a> to do the copying. The total price was $43 ($7.99 for the blank and $35 to have the copy made) which is more than I would like to spend on a key, but is significantly cheaper than going to the dealer. I wouldn’t say that Lexus is making a defective product since the keys were 13+ years old when they failed, but given that this seems to be a fairly common problem, perhaps Lexus should find a way to reduce the cost of replacements.</p>
